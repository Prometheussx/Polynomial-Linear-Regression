# Polynomial Regression 

## Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the use of Polynomial Regression, a type of regression analysis, for fitting nonlinear data. Polynomial Regression is a powerful technique for modeling relationships between the dependent and independent variables when the relationship is not linear.

In this project, we will walk through the process of implementing and using Polynomial Regression. We will use a dataset containing information about car prices and their corresponding maximum speeds to showcase the application of this technique.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following libraries and tools installed:

- Python (>= 3.0)
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas 
pip install scikit-learn 
pip install matplotlib
```

## Usage

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Prometheussx/polynomial-regression.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:


3. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the code and results:


4. Open the "polynomial_regression.ipynb" notebook and execute the cells to see the Polynomial Regression in action.

## Results

The project demonstrates how Polynomial Regression can be used to fit nonlinear data effectively. You will learn how to create polynomial features, fit the regression model, and make predictions.
